However, the button labels do not match the requested exact visible options, and the diff introduces unrequested authentication/actor infrastructure.",

      "reason": "The two buttons are not labeled exactly \"Yes\" and \"No\"; they include extra characters/emojis (\"Yes! 💕\" and \"No 😢\"), so the visible options are not exactly as specified.",
